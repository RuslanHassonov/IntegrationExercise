			// Filter the classes here with reflection so that when the "clazz" variable is the 'ImASecuredClass', the annotation is read from that class.
			// Add it's class name (which will of course be 'ImASecuredClass') to the first position of the arrray and the 'role' property (read from the annotation)
			// is added to the second position of the array.

			//So basically (in pseudo)
			// if clazz equals the 'ImASecuredClass' clazz
			// then: read the annotation 'Secured' from that class
			// 		 and: retrieve the class from that annotation, assign it to results[0]
			// 		 and: retrieve the property 'role' from that annotation and assign it's value to results[1]

			// Resume:
			// results[0] = the class which has the annotation (which will of course be 'ImASecuredClass')
			// results[1] = the value of the 'role' property parsed from the annotation on the class

			//Note: of course you can simply do: results[0]=ImASecuredClass.class and results[1]="admin", and the test will succeed. The goal is however
			//not to do that but to use the API for getting the annotation of the ImASecuredClass class, using the API to get the classname and the 'role' property
